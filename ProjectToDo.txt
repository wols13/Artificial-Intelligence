- Read and understand starter code:
	multiAgents.py
	pacman.py
	game.py
	util.py
	ghostAgents.py *not needed but might be useful*

- Implement MiniMax agent
	- multiAgents.py > MinimaxAgent > getAction() details the complete input/output specs
- Implement MiniMax agent with alpha-beta pruning 
- Implement ExpectiMax agent
- Implement Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent with UCB

- After implementing MCTS, read evaluation section again
- What you have now is version 1, check for subsequent releases and handle any deltas
- Look into the use of training sets with Monte-Carlo tree search
- Regularly check the clarifications page
- Read thru specs again and making sure you are abiding by every single rule/instruction
- 1st 3 Agents will be tested to ensure that correct nodes in the game tree search have been expanded
- Add more test cases yourself and test those as well as the subset given from course
- Test on cdf using python2 (version 2.7)
- What files to submit will be released in the final fixed project specification
