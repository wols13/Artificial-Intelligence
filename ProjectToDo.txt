- Implement UCT agent (Monte-Carlo Tree Search + UCB1)
	- Implement getAction()
				runSimulation()
				final()
	- Read input/output specs for those 3 functions


- After implementing MCTS, read evaluation section again
- Look into the use of training sets with Monte-Carlo tree search
- Regularly check the clarifications page
- Read thru specs again and making sure you are abiding by every single rule/instruction
- 1st 3 Agents will be tested to ensure that correct nodes in the game tree search have been expanded
- Add more test cases yourself and test those as well as the subset given from course
- Test on cdf using python2 (version 2.7)
